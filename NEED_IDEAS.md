# Need ideas to do?
- Button to orient the grabber downwards
- Slow down the lift in range of junction heights
  - Or have buttons to move to a certain junction height
- Sensitivity clutch by default
- Skid control
- Servo clutch
- Grab action button (to prevent the driver's terrible aim from slowing down grabbing)
  - Orients the grabber downwards, opens it, and moves as far downwards as possible, then closes
- Filter input (not to a high degree, just enough to stop microinputs from causing mistakes)
